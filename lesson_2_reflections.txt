1.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  When you initialize a repository a folder named ".git" is created, the folder is hidden.
  The repository initialization is needed since that ".git" folder would keep metadata that handles
  the repo's information.

2.How is the staging area different from the working directory and repository? What value do you think it offers?
  The staging area adds files that should be added to the future commit, the working directory is all
  the files and folders in the current directory, the repository is the set of all the files, folders and
  sub-folders used. The staging area is useful since it makes it possible to add certain set of files to one
  commit, the files used for the commit can be set in a logical way.

  The working directory: files modified that are not yet added to the staging area.
  The staging area: files added to a commit (files to be commited)
