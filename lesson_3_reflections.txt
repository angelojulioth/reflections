1.When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  It would be really useful to create a remote repository in order to make it avaliable for collaboration.
 
2.Why might you always want to pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
  with your remote repository?
  Because we should only pull from a remote repository if we want the latests changes made, otherwise, if git
  automatically dedided to stay up-to-date it would be harder to manage our changes (commits) if there are
  already other changes made within the remote repository.
