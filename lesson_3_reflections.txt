1.When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  It would be really useful to create a remote repository in order to make it avaliable for collaboration.
 
2.Why might you always want to pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
  with your remote repository?
  Because we should only pull from a remote repository if we want the latests changes made, otherwise, if git
  automatically dedided to stay up-to-date it would be harder to manage our changes (commits) if there are
  already other changes made within the remote repository.

3.Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  A fork is a clone of a github repository cloned directly to github's servers, the forked repo can be changed
  and those changes are just avaliable for that fork, but I think it may be possible to merge branches from a
  fork to the original repo.
  A clone is a cloned repo from a remote server into your local machine.
  A branch is a clone of the commit opened at the time of creating the new branch.
  A fork is useful if someone or a group of people want to change the source code of a repo and make their own
  version of a particular repo, so that the original repo remains without changes.
  A branch is useful if there's something that needs to be written into the code but may result a little buggy
  or may not work at all, so branches can be used to test and add new features, if the implementation is
  successful, then the commits from a particular branch can be merged.
